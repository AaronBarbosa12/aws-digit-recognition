This is a straightforward web application that leverages a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. The user is prompted to draw a number between 0 and 9. The application then captures the drawn image and sends an HTTP request to an AWS Lambda function. This function queries a containerized machine learning model that was previously trained on a dataset of handwritten digits. Once the model makes its prediction, it sends the result back to the user.
